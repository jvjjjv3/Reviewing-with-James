            <h1>A Satisfying Craving | 10/19/23</h1>
            
            <p>Let’s say you’re on your lunch break and you don’t have a lot of time, yet you are super hungry. What do you do? Well, if I were in such a situation, I’d take a trip to <em>Wendy’s</em>. For those of you who don’t know, Wendy’s is a popular fast-food chain that has locations in various countries around the world. Countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan. However, the majority of the restaurants are located in the good ol’ United States. Wendy’s was founded on November 15th, 1969, by someone named Dave Thomas.</p>

            <p>There are a variety of different options to choose from at Wendy’s, but I am going to do my best to recommend you the best items on the menu. Starting with the first item, <em>Dave’s Single</em>. The Dave’s Single is one of Wendy’s most popular burgers, and of course <b>my favorite!</b> It consists of a 4oz fresh, beef patty, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mayonnaise, topped together on a toasted bun. You can just get the burger alone, or you can order a combo meal instead. A combo meal comes with a drink of your choice, and a side, including <b>French Fries, Chili, Baked Potato, Side Salad, Apple Slices, or a Frosty</b>. I like to go for either the French Fries or the Chili, you won’t end up disappointed!</p>
            
            <p>Another popular item on the menu is the <b>Classic Chicken Sandwich</b>, it is also very delicious. It contains a lightly breaded and seasoned chicken fillet, lettuce, tomato, and mayo, topped on a toasted bun. Just like the first burger, you can either purchase it by itself or purchase the combo meal for a little extra. Wendy’s also has a <b>Spicy Chicken Sandwich</b>, but I wouldn’t recommend it personally because I am not a fan of spicy foods.</p>

            <p>So next time you’re on your lunch break and need something quick, please consider Wendy’s.</p>
