            <h1>Studying the Beautiful Game | 11/16/23</h1>
            
            <p>Hey you! Yeah, you! Have you ever wondered how soccer works? Sure, you might have a basic understanding of the sport, but wouldn’t you want to learn more about it? Soccer, also called football, has been around for a long time and has brought many people together. </p>

            <p>The sport has roots going all the way back thousands of years ago! As time progressed, however, it became more like what it is today. Soccer is played on a rectangular field with two goals at opposite ends, and each team has their own half of the field. Normally there are eleven players on both teams. Each team has <b>Forwards, Midfielders, Defenders,</b> and a <b>Goalie</b>. Forwards are normally played at the highest point, followed by the midfielders, the defenders, and then the goalie. The objective of the game is simple, to maneuver a soccer ball into the opponent’s goal to try and score. </p>
            
            <p>There are different techniques that are used in today’s game, such as <b>passing, dribbling,</b> and <b>shooting</b>! The team must collaborate effectively to try to win the game. In <b>1930</b>, the first <em> Fifa World Cup</em> took place. The World Cup is a competitive tournament consisting of many teams throughout the world. The first edition of this tournament had 13 different teams, with <b>Uruguay</b> being victorious!</p>

            <p>Going back to the modern-day game, one player that has had an immense influence on the soccer world is <em>Lionel Messi</em>. Messi is arguably the best player the world has ever seen. The Argentine is known for his skill, vision, and goal-scoring ability. I think that Messi is incredibly talented, he can take multiple defenders on at once. Not many players have the ability to do that. On top of that, the way that he caresses the ball is a definite game changer and a key reason for why he does so well.</p>

            <p>Messi’s performances during matches show that he is a true genius. He is so talented that he himself can determine the outcome of the game. Let’s say Argentina is in a losing position and there appears to be no way out, Messi can take on defenders and set up potential scoring opportunities out of nothing. Many people all over the world, including myself, admire Lionel Messi.</p>

            <p><<em>Now that you know more about soccer, why don’t you try practicing at a local park or something? Who knows, one day you might just become the next world’s best player.</em></p>
