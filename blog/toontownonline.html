            <h1>Revisiting Disney’s Toontown Online | 11/7/23</h1>
            
            <p>Hey everyone and welcome back to another blog post. For today’s post, we are going to be talking about a video game that was cherished by many people around the globe, including myself. For those of you who don’t know, <b>Disney’s Toontown Online</b> was a massive online multiplayer game that lasted an entire decade. As long as you had access to a <b>Windows</b> or <b>Mac</b> computer, you could sign up and play for free!</p>

            <p>Toontown came out a really long time ago, over 20 years ago, on <em>June 2nd, 2003</em>. While it’s true that the game was geared towards children, it was enjoyed by both children and adults alike! Upon making an account and downloading the game, users would have to create their “Toon”. A Toon is a virtual animal that players create and control in the game. Users could pick their own species and even customize their toon’s appearance. The species that were in the game at the time include: <b>Cats, Dogs, Ducks, Mice, Rabbits, Horses, Monkeys, Pigs, and Bears</b>.</p>
            
            <p>In the game, you had to complete a series of quests called Toontasks. However, there were some enemies of Toontown, they were called Cogs and they couldn’t take a joke. Your job was to defeat them by using silly items called <b>Gags</b>. There were four types of Cogs, <b> Bossbots, Sellbots, Cashbots, and Lawbots</b>. In total, there were <b>16</b> different types of Cogs. Different cogs were stationed in different areas of the game. These areas in the game were called <b>Playgrounds</b>, and there were 6 different areas to explore! Furthermore, players could purchase a membership to access more areas of the game!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, Disney’s Toontown Online was shut down on <em>September 19th, 2013</em>. This caused the Toontown Community lots of distress, and it prompted fans to recreate their own version of the game, called Toontown Rewritten. Basically, they coded Toontown Rewritten to mimc the original game, thus allowing players to play once again! This game is still around today and can be found at www.toontownrewritten.com. Did I mention this is <b>TOTALLY</b> free of charge?<p>
	<p>Now the question remains, <em> Are YOU Toon Enough?</p>
