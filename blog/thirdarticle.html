            <h1>Diving into Bikini Bottom | 10/16/23</h1>
            
            <p><em>Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?</em> That’s right everyone, today we are diving into the depths of the ocean to visit our beloved city, <b>Bikini Bottom.</b> Now I know what you all might be thinking, “I didn’t pack any swimwear”. Rest assured, I’ve got that taken care of. Instead of taking an actual dive into the ocean, <b>we are going to take a “virtual” one instead!</b></p>

            <p>The TV show <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> was created by Stephen Hillenburg in 1999. The series focuses on the adventures of the character, Spongebob Squarepants. Now Spongebob is someone who really loves his life. He loves going to work at the <em>Krusty Krab</em>, which is a fictional fast-food restaurant. During his downtime, he loves going jellyfishing, hanging out with his friends, and taking care of his pet snail, Gary.</p>

            <p>Spongebob has many different friends throughout Bikini Bottom, such as <b>Patrick Star</b>, <b>Sandy Cheeks</b>, <b> Mr. Krabs</b> and <b>Larry the Lobster</b>. However, his best friend is <b>Patrick Star</b>. Spongebob and Patrick basically do everything together, their bond is very strong. In addition, they both share their love for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who are “retired” superheroes. Spongebob and Patrick consider themselves their biggest fans!</p>

            <p>While Spongebob has many friends, he also has some acquaintances that are not so friendly towards him. People such as <b>Squidward Tentacles</b>, and <b>Plankton</b>. Spongebob and Squidward are next door neighbors and while Spongebob thinks they are friends, Squidward disagrees. Squidward is known for getting annoyed at Spongebob and wishes he moved away. As for Plankton, he too doesn’t like Spongebob. He tries to decieve Spongebob so that he can steal the <em>Krabby Patty Secret Formula</em> from the Krusty Krab. Luckily, Plankton always fails. Mr Krabs, who is also Spongebob’s boss, is the main reason why Plankton never succeeds.</p>

            <p><b>If you’ve made it this far, I applaud you. It’s great talking about this wonderful show that’s still around today. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to change out of my swimsuit, I’m soaking wet! Until next time.</b></p>
