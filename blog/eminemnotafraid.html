            <h1>Songbird’s Flight through Fear’s Tempest | 12/10/23</h1>
            
            <p>People have a different way of coping with fear. Some may internalize it, while others may seek help. On the other hand, there are people who may turn their fear into words, and sometimes, into lyrics. One prime example of someone who captures fear perfectly is a rapper called <b>Eminem</b>. His actual name is <em>Marshall Bruce Mathers III</em>.</p>

            <p>Born on October 17th, 1972, Eminem published his first album called <em>Infinite</em> when he was 24 years old. As time went on, he published more and more albums. Today, we are going to be talking about a certain song that Eminem wrote called <em>Not Afraid</em>. The song was released in <b>2010</b> as a single from his seventh studio album, <em>Recovery</em>.</p>
            
            <p>He wrote the song to reflect on his personal struggles. He openly shares his battles with addiction, public scrutiny, and personal demons. He encourages people to help him in the battle, saying they aren’t alone. One verse of the song goes “I’m not afraid to take a stand, everybody come take my hand”. This is metaphorically saying that Eminem needs support. </p>

            <p>Overall, the song was very popular worldwide. Many people were able to find the lyrics to be relatable. This is my favorite Eminem song, and I definitely agree that these lyrics are inspiring. The way that he raps the words with such rhythm makes it even more compelling. <b>If you are interested, this song is available on Spotify to listen to for no cost at all.</b></p>
