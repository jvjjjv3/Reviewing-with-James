            <h1>Coming in with a Slam Dunk | 12/19/23</h1>
            
            <p>So far you’ve heard about Baseball and Soccer, so now it’s time to talk about a new sport that is also appreciated by many. I’m talking about the wonders of <b>Basketball</b>, a game that emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and problem-solving skills. Whether you’re playing the sport in the park with friends, or playing on a team, it definitely is a memorial experience!</p>

            <p>It’s actually very interesting on how the sport game to be. Back in <em>December 1891</em>, a Canadian physical education instructor by the name of Dr. James Naismith invented the sport, at the <em>International YMCA Training School</em> in Springfield, Massachusetts. He had to entertain his students, who couldn’t go outside because of the cold weather. He made the game by hanging baskets at each end of the gymnasium and creating rules on how to play. Believe it or not, but the first basketball wasn’t actually a basketball, it was a soccer ball!</p>
            
            <p>Basketball is about dribbling a ball and trying to get it inside the net! Players have to make split second decisions about whether to continue dribbling or to pass to another teammate. Also players can commit fouls (offenses) against other players which result in penalties, such as a foul shot. The goal is obviously to not commit fouls, of course. There are also 4 quarters in a game, each lasting 12 minutes. I must also mention that each point (ball being successfully thrown into the net) counts as <b>2</b>, except when you score a <b>3</b> pointer, but that’s only if you score in a certain area.</p>

            <p>Over time, basketball became more and more like today’s game! In the modern game, there is the <em>NBA</em>. This stands for the <em>National Basketball Association</em>. It started back in <em>1946</em> and has evolved into a top tier league with a vast amount of talent. There are a total of 30 teams in the NBA, which compete in the season. The top <b>8</b> teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The team that is most victorious in the playoffs wins the NBA Finals. </p>

            <p>I love the sport, it really gets the blood pumping when I play. Whether i’m playing with friends or watching a game on television, I must remember to thank Dr. James Naismith for making this possible! He is a genius.</p>
