            <h1>Here We Go! | 10/7/23</h1>
            
            <p>Imagine it’s a beautiful, sunny day outside and you are lying in your hammock. What could be more fun than whipping out your favorite Nintendo device and playing some games? Nintendo is an amazing company that’s been around for a very long time. The company was founded back in 1889, by someone named Fusajiro Yamauchi. Obviously, video games were not invented yet. At this time, Nintendo was solely a playing card company. Nintendo didn’t establish itself as a video game company until the late 1970s.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released thousands of video games since that time. Today, we are going to talk about a couple of their key releases. Starting with my favorite, <em>New Super Mario Bros</em>. This game was released for the <em>Nintendo DS</em> on May 15th, 2006. As millions of copies were sold around the globe, the game was a literal hit. Upon playing the game, players would play as <em>Mario</em> or his brother <em>Luigi</em> and venture through the game trying to save the kidnapped <em>Princess Peach</em> from the hands of <em>Bowser</em>. In addition, the game had a mini game mode for fun as well as a multiplayer mode.</p>

            <p>Another big game that Nintendo released is called <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. The game is much more recent than the first game we talked about, releasing on December 7th, 2018 for the <em>Nintendo Switch</em>. It was also a huge hit, and it became one of the console’s most important releases of all time. Unlike the other game where it was limited to certain characters, this game has many characters to choose from. In addition, you could unlock more over time! <em>Super Smash Bros</em> is a PVP (Player Versus Player) game where players control characters from different Nintendo games and fight each other in battles. Trust me, you’ll have a blast playing it!</p>

            <p><strong><em>Happy Gaming!!</em></strong></p>
