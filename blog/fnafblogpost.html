            <h1>Surviving the Animatronics: A FNaF Insider | 11/27/23</h1>
            
            <p>Have you ever heard of a horror game called <em>Five Night’s At Freddy’s</em>? It was released to the public on <em>August 8th, 2014</em> by someone named <em>Scott Cawthon</em>. This revolutionized the horror game world for the better. </p>
            
            <img src="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fhyt8j1xde6f41.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df360c830a04586afcdeebdc27004084fcd6495a2" alt=“FNaF 1” width="400" height="300">
            
            <p>So when the game is loaded up, users are prompted with a menu screen.. This menu displays the game’s title, along with options such as <em>New Game</em> and <em>Continue</em>. Pressing “New Game” starts from the beginning, but “Continue” allows users to continue where they have left off if they’ve played before. This straightforward interface contributes to the overall game experience.</p>
            
            <p>When a user presses “New Game”, it triggers a newspaper clipping that appears on the screen. It mentions the closure of <em>Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza</em> due to reports of children going missing and suspicions regarding the animatronic characters. Your role in the game is to be a Night Security Guard and to watch the store during the nighttime, protecting against any unusual activity that may happen. The animatronic characters, who are normally friendly during the day, become active at night and start to roam around the store. There are 4 different animatronics, including <em>Freddy Fazbear</em>, <em>Bonnie the Bunny</em>, <em>Chica the Chicken</em>, and <em>Foxy the Pirate Fox</em>. No one knows their next move. You must constantly be on the alert, as these animatronics are trying to attack you.</p>

            <p>However, this job is not so easy. You have limited resources, such as limited power and restricted usage. If you see that an animatronic is near, you may need to temporarily close the door, which drains a lot of power. In addition, both doors have a light button that you can turn on to see into the area, but that also drains power so be careful on how much you use it. You start the game at midnight, and it ends at 6 AM. Each in game minute is approximately one real life minute.</p>

            <p>Do you know what happens if an animatronic comes in? <b>They’ll jump at ya!</b> When this happens, you’ll see it appear on the screen accompanied by a startling sound. This is a frightening visual. The most common experience is <b>startle and shock</b>, which is what happens to me when I play the game. I really enjoy it for the thrill of it!</p>

            <p>When playing the game, besides startle and shock, I feel anxious. I have to constantly keep checking the cameras and seeing where these animatronics are going, which can be tedious and fosters a sense of unease. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’m just desperately waiting for it to be day time so that I can finish the shift. I love the designs of the animatronics, they are very colorful. I also love the setting and the decorations. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I will see you next time!</p>
