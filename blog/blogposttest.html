            <h1>Take Me Out to the Ball Game | 10/2/23</h1>
            
            <p>Hello everyone and welcome to our first official blog post! It truly is an honor to be here today. I thought long and hard about what our topic should be, and I couldn’t be more happy about it. Let’s talk about America’s favorite pastime, baseball. Who doesn’t love baseball, am I right?</p>

            <p>Let’s dive in to when this beautiful game was invented. There was no single person to invent the sport, however, it actually evolved from older bat-and-ball games. These games date back to several hundreds, if not thousands of years ago! Very similar to how baseball works today, the objective of these bat-and-ball games was to hit a ball with a bat and then run around a set of bases or markers. These games were more for recreational purposes though. Over time, baseball became more professionalized, just like how it is today!</p>
            
            <p>Throughout baseball’s history, there have been many great players to play the game on the big stage. Big named players such as <strong>Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Derek Jeter, Aaron Judge, Lou Gehrig, and Mickey Mantle.</strong> These players were very talented and adored by many fans across the globe. Some of the most iconic baseball teams include <em>The New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox,</em> and the <em>Detroit Tigers</em>.</p>
