            <h1>Have a Frightful Halloween | 10/19/23</h1>
            
             <p><em>From the eerie tales of witches and werewolves to the haunting stories of ghosts, this time of year is filled with spine-tingling surprises, and the occasional 'Boo!' just adds to the thrill. You aren't shaking, right? I hope I didn't scare you. I just <b>love</b> this time of year!</em></p>

            <p>There are a variety of different options to choose from at Wendy’s, but I am going to do my best to recommend you the best items on the menu. Starting with the first item, <em>Dave’s Single</em>. The Dave’s Single is one of Wendy’s most popular burgers, and of course <b>my favorite!</b> It consists of a 4oz fresh, beef patty, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mayonnaise, topped together on a toasted bun. You can just get the burger alone, or you can order a combo meal instead. A combo meal comes with a drink of your choice, and a side, including <b>French Fries, Chili, Baked Potato, Side Salad, Apple Slices, or a Frosty</b>. I like to go for either the French Fries or the Chili, you won’t end up disappointed!</p>
            
            <p>Another popular item on the menu is the <em>Classic Chicken Sandwich</em>, it is also very delicious. It contains a lightly breaded and seasoned chicken fillet, lettuce, tomato, and mayo, topped on a toasted bun. Just like the first burger, you can either purchase it by itself or purchase the combo meal for a little extra. Wendy’s also has a <em>Spicy Chicken Sandwich</em>, but I wouldn’t recommend it personally because I am not a fan of spicy foods.</p>

            <p>So next time you’re on your lunch break and need something quick, please consider Wendy’s.</p>
