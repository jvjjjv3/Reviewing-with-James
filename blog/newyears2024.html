            <h1>Have a Happy New Year | 1/1/24</h1>
            
            <p>Hey everyone, and welcome to the first post of the <b>New Year.</b> At the start of the new year, I like to think about New Year’s resolutions. For those unaware, a New Year’s resolution is a personal commitment people make at the start of the year to improve certain aspects of their lives or to achieve specific goals. Examples of New Year resolutions include: <b>Health and Fitness, Career and Education,</b> and <b>Relationships and Social Life</b>.</p>

            <p>It is important to stay committed to achieving these goals throughout the year. It’s okay if you aren’t seeing results right away, these things take time and can take months if not most of the year. When you finally start to see results, you will be overjoyed!</p>
